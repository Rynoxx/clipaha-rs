# clipaha-rs

A Rust implementation of the [**Cli**entside **pa**ssword **ha**shing research](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1746.pdf) and [clipaha JS/WASM library](https://github.com/clipaha/clipaha) by Francisco et. al.  
Inspired by Francisco's talk at FOSSNorth 2023.

Used to offload password hashing to the client, different strengths available which target different system specs. E.g. itâ€™s not suitable to run with Ultra strength on an old smartphone.

The resulting hashes should still be hashed with a low-cost hash before being stored in a DB, such as SHA-384, or SHA-512, to prevent direct usage of the hash in the database for authentication against the service should the database be compromised.
